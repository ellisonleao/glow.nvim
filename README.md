# glow.nvim

A [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) preview directly in your neovim buffer.

## Installing

**NOTE: This plugin requires Neovim 0.5 versions**

with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```
Plug 'npxbr/glow.nvim', {'do': ':GlowInstall', 'branch': 'main'}
```

with [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```
use {"npxbr/glow.nvim", run = "GlowInstall"}
```

## Usage

```
:Glow [path-to-md-file]
```

- Pressing `q` will automatically close the window
- No path arg means glow uses current path in vim
- `:Glow` command will work as toogle feature, so calling it will open or close the current preview

You can also create a mapping getting a preview of the current file

```viml
noremap <leader>p :Glow<CR>
```
For users who want to make glow.nvim buffer fullscreen, there's a native vim keybinding :
- `Ctrl-w + |`  set window's width max
- `Ctrl-w + _` set window's height max

Or you can have a fullscreen option by creating a mapping for setting both window's height and width max at once :

```viml
noremap <C-w>z <C-w>\|<C-w>\_
```
